📌 Objectives
Analyze suicide rates by age, gender, and race/ethnicity
Identify long-term temporal trends (1950–2020)
Understand demographic disparities
Provide data-driven recommendations for prevention strategies

🗂️ Dataset
Title: Death rates for suicide by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age – United States
Source: data.gov
Records: 6,390 (1950–2020)

The dataset includes:

Suicide rate per 100,000 population
Age group, gender, race/ethnicity
Yearly records and flags for interpretative caution

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python, pandas, NumPy
Data cleaning and transformation
Visualizations: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Analysis Overview
1. Data Cleaning
Dropped redundant and duplicate columns
Renamed variables for clarity
Handled missing values by removing incomplete rows
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trends over time: Suicide rates declined until 2000s, then increased
Age analysis: Elderly (85+) had the highest rates
Gender: Males represent nearly 80% of suicides
Race/Ethnicity: White and American Indian males had the highest rates
3. Correlation & Visualization
Created line plots, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps
Weak correlation found between year and suicide rate, indicating non-linear influence of external factors

🧠 Key Insights
1.Demographics Matter: Age, gender, and race significantly influence suicide trends
2.Elderly & Male Vulnerability: These groups are at highest risk
3.Recent Rise: Since 2010, suicide rates have trended upward again
4.Policy Implication: Need for gender-specific and elderly-focused interventions
